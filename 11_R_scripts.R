# Scripts are useful as they allow one
# to easily pick up where they left on 
# a project and progressively 
# build and refine code and analysis
# They also allow one to easily reproduce
# analysis run earlier...

#A script is a set of commands that usually 
#includes commenting on what each piece of code is
#intended to do....

# i am working in r script since the begining
# ctrl+shift+c to comment
